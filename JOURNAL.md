# 6/24/2025

- Did a lot of unfocused researched, and also hopped in a huddle (voicechat) with @Cyao and asked a lot of questions about incorperating RF into a design
- Confirmed what exactly I wanted to build, which would be a devboard with the 2350B MCU for maximum GPIO and a routing challenge. I would also want to include WIFI connectivity like the PI Pico W, which would make it useful in projects that require things like API calls based on peripherals.

**Time: Untimed, especially since this research was unfocused**
